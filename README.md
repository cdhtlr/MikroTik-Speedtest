# MikroTik-Speedtest
MikroTik-Terminal friendly Ookla Speedtest.net (with or without Librespeed self hosted speedtest)

There are two variants of images:
- Libre variant is the most complete variant with self-hosted Librespeed running on Apache2 webserver.
- Lite variant is lighter variant (without Librespeed) and running on built-in PHP webserver.

The main difference between the two variants is the 50% larger disk space requirement of the Libre variant.
